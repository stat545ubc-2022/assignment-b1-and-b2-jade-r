# Quick.Group.Summarise

The goal of Quick.Group.Summarise is to take your specified data set and group by a variable you specify (x) and then summarise the mean of another variable you specify (y) across x. It will output a new tibble. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of Quick.Group.Summarise from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-jade-r")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the code:

```{r example}
library(Quick.Group.Summarise)

quick_group_summarise(datateachr::steam_games, genre, original_price)
#This example should produce a tibble with the mean price for each genre
```
