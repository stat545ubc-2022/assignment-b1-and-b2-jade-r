# Jade Radke's Assignment B1 for STAT545B

## This repository contains my submission for Assignment B1 for STAT545B at UBC. 

In the file titled "Assignment_B1" you will find a new function titled "quick_group_summarise" that I have made. This new function allows you to quickly group by a variable in your selected data set (x) and summarizes the mean of a chosen numeric variable (y) for each value in the grouped by variable (x) and produces a new tibble. 

In this file I have also documented the function, provided examples, and conducting formal tests. 

Feel free to try out my new function for yourself! ✨ ❤️ ✨
